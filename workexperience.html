                                    I designed and developed an Android application alongside external

                                    I meticulously weighed architecture options, researching the prior solutions to this 
                                    problem extensively and understanding where they failed. I designed my application to 
                                    address data privacy and memory utilization issues. Due to my detailed research, I was able to answer

                                    Despite initial reservations about entrusting an intern with a complex app project, I rapidly 
                                    self-learned Android development and presented a prototype in the early design phase. 
                                    Throughout the development, I tackled numerous challenges, from dependency issues to communication 
                                    breakdowns between services. My proactive approach to problem-solving, combined with regular

                                    and two accompanying services by the internship's end.

                            assigned to me, but also experimented with my own reports. For example, I saw that users 
                            tended to drop off during the process of signing up for the account. After looking at the app, 
                            I saw that the sign up process was very long and required lots of information from the user 
                            which could possibly make them disinterested. I recommended that MayV shorten this process. Furthermore, 
                            I also investigated the pattern between users receiving emails from MayV and their usage of the app.
